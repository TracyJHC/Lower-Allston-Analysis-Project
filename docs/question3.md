2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Address the 4 residents with limited store access and 4 with limited park access
3. **Comprehensive Support**: Create integrated services for residents facing multiple barriers

### Data Gaps

1. **Store Data**: 48.1% of elderly lack store accessibility data - consider improving data collection
2. **Condition Data**: 28.6% of elderly lack housing condition data - expand property assessment coverage
3. **Income Data**: Census tract median income is a proxy - consider individual income data collection
