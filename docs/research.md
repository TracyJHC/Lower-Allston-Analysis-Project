### Project_research

Research on aging in place shows that many older adults prefer to remain in their homes and communities, but this desire often conflicts with barriers such as rising housing costs, inadequate accessibility features, and risks of social isolation (Wiles et al., 2012). The annual Greater Boston Housing Report Card tracks affordability trends across the region, documenting how seniors are disproportionately affected by housing pressures (2024). We are therefore motivated to dig deep into how targeted senior housing interventions are necessary in Allston-Brighton. Building upon the scholarship on aging in place, and after meeting with the client last week, we decided to place the focus of our project on the access to resources that are important to the elderly. As discussed in the project definition, we will be bringing additional datasets to be combined with the Voter List data, to construct richer data for analysis. We looked into possible measures for POIs and housing values, and decided to bring in datasets from third-party sources such as Zillow into the analysis.
