# Question 5: What would be the impact on the housing market if they transitioned to senior housing?

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the housing market impact of transitioning elderly residents to a new **50-60 unit affordable senior housing project** in Allston-Brighton. The analysis identifies an **expanded outreach pool of 200-300 priority candidates** (to account for 20-30% response rates) and assesses what properties would become available if elderly homeowners transition to the new housing.

**Key Findings**:
- **Expanded Outreach Pool**: 300 top priority candidates identified for outreach (to fill 50-60 units)
- **Top 60 Candidates**: Of the top 60 priority candidates, **26 are homeowners** whose properties (valued at approximately **$26.6 million total**) would become available
- **Expanded Pool Impact**: The full 200-300 candidate pool includes significantly more homeowners, with estimated property values that would become available if 20-30% accept
- The remaining candidates are renters or have unknown tenure status, meaning their transition would free up rental units rather than properties for sale

3. **Income Need**: 95% are Low Income, 5% Moderate Income
4. **Housing Conditions**: 46.7% have poor/fair conditions, 6.7% have violations

### Outreach Recommendations

1. **Geographic Focus**: Prioritize Ward 21 Precinct 7 (Census Tract 7.03) with 33 candidates, then Ward 22 Precincts 1, 5, and 2
2. **Demographic Targeting**: Focus on ages 70-89 (63.3% of candidates), all Low Income (95%)
3. **Condition-Based Outreach**: Target the 28 candidates (46.7%) with poor/fair housing conditions
4. **Multi-Channel Approach**: 
   - Door-to-door in top 3 census tracts (57 candidates)
   - Community events in Ward 21 and Ward 22
   - Mail outreach to all 60 candidates

---

## 8. Alternative Selection Strategies

### Strategy 1: Prioritize Renters

**Rationale**: Renters may have more urgent housing needs and face rent increases or displacement.

**Results**:
- **Selected**: 60 renter candidates
- **Average eligibility score**: 36.2
- **Note**: This strategy selects renters from the High/Medium priority pool, resulting in lower average scores than the primary strategy (36.2 vs 42.7)

### Strategy 2: Prioritize Low/Moderate Income

**Rationale**: Focus on residents with greatest financial need.

**Results**:
- **Selected**: 0 candidates
- **Note**: The primary strategy already prioritizes Low/Moderate Income candidates (95% of top 60 are Low Income), so this alternative strategy doesn't provide additional candidates

### Strategy 3: Prioritize Housing Conditions

**Rationale**: Target residents facing poor housing conditions or violations.

**Results**:
- **Selected**: 60 candidates with housing issues (poor conditions or violations)
- **Average eligibility score**: 39.2
- **Note**: This strategy focuses on residents with housing quality problems, with slightly lower average scores than primary strategy (39.2 vs 42.7)

## 9. Neighborhood-Level Impact

### Impact by Census Tract

**Analysis**: Distribution of candidates and property values across neighborhoods.

**Top Affected Neighborhoods** (by candidate count and property value):

1. **Census Tract 7.03** (Median Income: $46,985)
   - Candidates: 33
   - Homeowners: 5
   - Total Property Value: $6,908,300

2. **Census Tract 101.03** (Median Income: $45,000)
   - Candidates: 14
   - Homeowners: 10
   - Total Property Value: $14,052,500

3. **Census Tract 6.03** (Median Income: $33,229)
   - Candidates: 10
   - Homeowners: 9
   - Total Property Value: $8,464,800

4. **Census Tract 5.06** (Median Income: $73,403)
   - Candidates: 2
   - Homeowners: 1
   - Total Property Value: $2,608,700

5. **Census Tract 8.05** (Median Income: $53,824)
   - Candidates: 1
   - Homeowners: 1
   - Total Property Value: $592,100

**Summary**:
- **Total neighborhoods affected**: 5 census tracts
- **Neighborhoods with homeowners**: 5 (all affected neighborhoods have homeowners)
- **Total estimated property value**: $32,626,400 (higher than individual candidate total due to neighborhood aggregation)

**Key Insight**: The impact is concentrated in three low-income census tracts (7.03, 101.03, and 6.03), which together account for 57 candidates and $29.4M in property value. This concentration suggests the project would have a focused but manageable effect on specific neighborhoods rather than a broad, dispersed impact.

1. **Outreach Pool**: 300 priority candidates identified (30 High + 270 Medium priority)
2. **Average Eligibility Score**: 37.1 (range: 35-50)
3. **Tenure Mix**: 50.0% homeowners, 30.0% renters, 20.0% unknown
4. **Total Homeowner Property Value**: $163.3M (150 homeowners, avg $1.09M per property)
5. **Estimated Market Impact** (if 20-30% accept): $31.5M-$47.8M property value (30-45 homeowners)
6. **Geographic Distribution**: Ward 22 (66.3%), Ward 21 (33.7%)
7. **Top Census Tracts**: Tract 101.03 (115 candidates), Tract 7.03 (95 candidates), Tract 6.03 (75 candidates)

**Top 60 Candidates**:
1. **Project Scale**: 60 priority candidates identified for 50-60 unit project (30 High + 30 Medium priority)
2. **Property Availability**: 26 homeowner properties ($26.6M value) would become available
3. **Market Impact**: Concentrated impact in 3 low-income census tracts (95% of candidates)
4. **Tenure Mix**: 43.3% homeowners, 10.0% renters, 46.7% unknown
5. **Property Values**: Average $1.02M per homeowner property (range: $592k-$1.38M)
6. **Candidate Profile**: Average age 76.2, 95% Low Income, 46.7% with poor housing conditions
7. **Geographic Concentration**: 33 candidates (55%) in Census Tract 7.03 alone

### Market Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts**:
- **Expanded Pool**: 150 homeowner properties ($163.3M value) in outreach pool
- **Top 60**: 26 properties would become available for new residents or redevelopment
- **Estimated Impact**: $31.5M-$47.8M property value if 20-30% of homeowners accept
- 90+ rental units would become available from renter candidates
- Properties are moderate-to-high value (avg $1.09M), contributing to housing supply

**Considerations**:
- **Expanded Pool**: 20% unknown tenure limits full impact assessment (better than top 60's 46.7%)
- Property values suggest these are established homeowners with equity
- Geographic concentration in 3 census tracts enables efficient outreach but may create localized market impact
- All affected neighborhoods have homeowner candidates, ensuring property availability
- Expanded pool provides buffer for lower response rates while maintaining high eligibility scores

## Recommendations

### For Outreach Program

1. **Expanded Outreach Pool**: Target 200-300 candidates from the expanded pool to ensure sufficient response for 50-60 units
2. **Prioritize Top 60**: Focus initial outreach on the top 60 highest-scoring candidates
3. **Geographic Concentration**: Prioritize Ward 21 Precinct 7 (Census Tract 7.03) with highest candidate concentration, then Ward 22 Precincts 1, 5, and 2
4. **Tenure Verification**: Collect tenure data for unknown candidates to better assess market impact
5. **Multi-Strategy Approach**: Consider alternative strategies (renter-priority or condition-priority) if primary candidates don't respond
6. **Age-Specific Outreach**: Focus on 70-89 age group who may be most ready to transition
7. **Phased Outreach**: Start with top 60, expand to full 200-300 pool based on response rates

### For Market Impact Planning

1. **Property Transition Support**: Provide services to help homeowners transition
2. **Market Monitoring**: Track property sales and rental availability post-transition
3. **Neighborhood Engagement**: Communicate with affected neighborhoods about project
4. **Housing Supply Analysis**: Assess how new availability affects local housing supply

### For Project Planning

1. **Flexible Capacity**: Plan for 50-60 units with ability to adjust based on candidate response
2. **Outreach Timeline**: Allow sufficient time for outreach to 200-300 candidates (phased approach: start with top 60, expand as needed)
3. **Response Rate Planning**: Plan for 20-30% acceptance rate, requiring 200-300 candidates to fill 50-60 units
4. **Alternative Candidates**: Maintain expanded pool of 300 candidates if initial outreach is unsuccessful
5. **Data Collection**: Improve tenure data collection to better assess market impact across expanded pool

## Methodology Notes

### Candidate Selection Method

**Primary Strategy**: Select top 60 candidates by eligibility score from High/Medium priority pool
- Ensures highest need residents are prioritized
- Balances High priority (30) with Medium priority (30)
- Average score of 42.7 indicates strong eligibility

**Alternative Strategies Available**:
- Renter-priority: Focus on renters with urgent housing needs
- Income-priority: Focus on low/moderate income residents
- Condition-priority: Focus on residents with housing quality issues

### Market Impact Calculation

**Property Values**:
- Based on `total_value` from buildings table (FY2025 assessments)
- Represents assessed value, not market value
- May differ from actual sale prices

**Units Available**:
- Based on `res_units` from buildings table
- Represents residential units in each property
- May include owner-occupied units that would become available

### Limitations

1. **Tenure Data**: 46.7% of candidates have unknown tenure status
2. **Property Values**: Assessed values may differ from market values
3. **Transition Timing**: Analysis assumes all candidates transition simultaneously
4. **Market Dynamics**: Cannot predict actual market response to property availability
5. **Rental Impact**: Limited data on rental units that would become available
