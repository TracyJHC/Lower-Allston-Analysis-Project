## Recommendations

### Priority Groups for Affordable Senior Housing

1. **High Priority (30 residents)**: Immediate candidates
   - Low income + housing quality issues or violations
   - Strongest need for affordable senior housing

2. **Medium Priority (1,050 residents)**: Strong candidates
   - Combination of income eligibility, housing conditions, or other need factors
   - Would benefit significantly from affordable senior housing

3. **Low Priority (5,878 residents)**: Lower immediate need
   - Generally have adequate housing and income
   - May still benefit from affordable senior housing options

### Geographic Targeting

- Focus on **census tracts with lower median incomes** (<$75k)
- Prioritize areas with **high elderly concentration** and **housing quality issues**
- Consider **Tract 101.03** ($45k median income, 232 elderly) as a priority area

### Housing Development Considerations

- **1,080 residents** (15.5%) qualify as Medium to High priority
- This represents a significant demand for affordable senior housing
- Development should prioritize:
  - Low-income elderly (562 residents)
  - Those with housing quality issues (133 residents)
  - Those with property violations (35 residents)

## Methodology Notes

### Data Limitations

1. **Income Data**: Only 68.5% of elderly have census tract income data (4,757 of 6,938)
2. **Housing Conditions**: Only 71.4% have condition data (4,953 of 6,938)
3. **Store Data**: Only 51.9% have store proximity data (3,598 of 6,938)
4. **Park Data**: 100% coverage achieved

### Exclusion Rationale

Residents in income-restricted or senior housing (12 addresses, ~458 residents) were excluded because:
- They already have access to affordable/subsidized housing
- Including them would overestimate demand
- Focus should be on those without current affordable housing options

### Scoring System Rationale

The scoring system prioritizes:
1. **Financial need** (income eligibility) - 40% of maximum points
2. **Housing quality barriers** (conditions, violations) - 35% of maximum points
3. **Residency stability** (community ties) - 10% of maximum points
4. **Amenity access limitations** - 10% of maximum points

This weighting reflects that financial need and housing quality are the primary drivers of eligibility for affordable senior housing.
