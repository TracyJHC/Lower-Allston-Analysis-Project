### Project_definition

This project aims to support the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation (ABCDC) in identifying elderly residents (aged 62 and older) in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood who may be eligible for new affordable senior housing developments. The core objective is to build a data-driven foundation for equitable outreach, housing readiness assessment, and neighborhood impact forecasting. To do this, our team will utilize a combination of datasets, including voter registration records (which include age and address information), Point of Interests that are important to the elderly population, and housing prices records. Using those sources, our team will generate a structured dataset, geographic visualizations (GIS maps), and a narrative report highlighting resident distribution, tenure patterns, and key outreach recommendations. The insight will allow ABCDC to better understand where elderly residents live, assess their housing conditions, anticipate service needs, and ensure that future affordable housing initiatives are planned with equity and data-informed precision.
